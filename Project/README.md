# coffee-shop-vue-project

Coffee Shop Vue Project Template has an authorization form (which can check the existing account data or create the new one), several routing pages, a shopping cart, delivery information form, a modal window (which can be reused in different components) and useful notifications.
You can receive data from server (list of products from the main page), sort items by price (ascending/descending), add selected items to the shopping cart, change their quantity (increase/decrease/delete items from the cart) and fill in the delivery information form (which checks the correctness of the filled-in fields and sends this information to the server).
This project has a responsive web design and was built by using Vue.js, Vue CLI, Vuex, Node.js, Express framework, Ajax requests, HTTP methods (GET/POST), JSON, etc.
